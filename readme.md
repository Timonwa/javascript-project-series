# Javascript Projects Article series on Timonwa's Notes.
## 5+ mini projects to boost your Javascript skills.

This repository contains all the codes to each Javascript projects from my Javascript project article series on my [blog](https://blog.timonwa.com).

The [Javascript Projects Series](https://blog.timonwa.com/javascript-projects) is a collection of written tutorials where I will be picking javascript projects one at a time, giving step by step tutorials on how to build them from scratch with ease.

As I publish each new project article, you will find the corresponding source codes here. The code of each projects are contained in folders with the corresponding names of the Javascript projects. You can also the find direct links to the folders below along with the live links to view the code in action.

Feel free to fork this repo and use the codes for learning, practicing and building your own unique projects. And please give this a **Star** also, it would mean a lot to me. The Star and Fork button can be found at the top right corner.
